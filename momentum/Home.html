 The journey of a thousand miles begin with a step. So, why are you afraid of initiating the first step?
You have all it takes to move to the next stage in life but harnessing the energy around you might be difficult and impossible.
But you should know that you will have to sacrifice what you have to get what you need
If Your energy is getting low and it seems like you are losing focus,keep your head high.
Don't be distracted by elements of retrogression. 
Set your goals for the new year and keep your head straight.
Motivate yourself. Remember that, if you are riding a bicycle and you want to keep moving, you must balance your fulcrum.
Balance the fulcrum between the loads of your life and the effort you applied to overcome them.  
The future is brighter, can't you see?  why being skeptical about your ability to challenge and change the status quo?
Why do you want to live behind the threshold of your lineage and not beyond?
A new cycle of life is approaching, make the necessary corrections now.
Motivate yourself! Build yourself! We are with you, now and always!</blockquote></h5>

<br> IMPORTANT NOTICE TO THE PARENTS OF ASEGUN
COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL AS RESUMPTION IS NEAR: <blockquote>One thing is to enroll your child(ren) in school, another is to keep track of their 
performance and checkmate their result with the previous ones at the end of every term.
Despite our relentless efforts, some students still find it hard to catch up
 with several systems we introduced in other to boost their mental health and improve their academic performance.
It was revealed to me personally some days ago that some parents are the 
mastermind behind their child(ren) poor academic performance in the school. 
Some parents don't cross check their child(ren) notes not to talk of telling them to read their books.
In the second week of resumption, several skeletal framework we have for the students were launched.
A part of it is the senior secondary school weekly test that holds every Friday. The result of the test is rated in percentage and it's attached to the school notice board every Monday for the students to see. 
The first test went well and today, we had our 3rd test for SS1, 2nd for Ss2 and the 1st for Ss3 students.
You can ask for their 30 days writing challenge note, morning lesson note and one-hour after school note, the position they are on the last test and the topic for next week assembly talk and the day 9 of the 30 days writing challenge.
There are several programs going on in school in which These students keep their parents clueless. 
Ask your child those questions above and give us feedback.
This week test results is poor as 
 many of these students got below average {Ss2 and Ss3} Ss1 students' script is yet to be marked.
I appeal to you my dear parents, The management and members of staff are doing everything we are capable of to give these students the 21st century education 
but some parents are standing in our way and therefore, rendering out efforts useless.
Please, do help to force them to read their books. 
We appreciate your provision and may the Lord reward you in a thousand fold. The textbooks you bought for them are meant to be read. 
Their notes are meant to be read and so is their assignments.
Together, we can give our best to make them a greater person in life. Encourage book reading at home. 
Buy them novels and always supervise their activities in school.
May we all eat the fruit of our labour.
Thank you.

    the long awaiting day finally came today.
    The grand finale of the cup was held at AWOLOWO PITCH, University of Ibadan. <br>
    We are happy to tell you that we participated in almost all the events except for basketball and volleyball. 
    Our athletes and players did exceptionally well. 
    most especially, the school football team that played against brightville college.<br> 
    
    Despite the stratagem physically displayed by the referee and his officiating team, 
    the match ended with 3-3 on both sides and was proceeded to penalty shootout. <br>
    The opponent's cunning and plot eventually paid off as we were defeated with 
    five goals to three at the penalty shootout. The boys did well and thus came second in the tournament.<br>
    We are not stagnant as several methodologies have been implemented to raise our 
    students standard and to improve their academic performance in this new session.<br>
    We are here to nurse the steps of our students and make sure their foots are set on the right path. 
    And as we do these, Please bear with us any inconveniences we may be putting you through. <br>
